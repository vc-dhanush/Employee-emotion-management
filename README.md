🚀 **Project Launch: Zidio AI-Powered Task Optimizer**  
🔍 *Harnessing Emotion Analytics to Boost Workplace Productivity*

I'm excited to share my recent project — **Zidio**, an AI-powered task optimizer built to transform workplace productivity and well-being through real-time emotion detection and analytics.

💡 **What It Does**:  
Zidio uses **data science** and **machine learning** to interpret employees' emotional states using inputs like text, facial expressions, and speech. Based on this data, the system:

✅ Detects stress, burnout, or low morale in real time  
✅ Sends **alerts to HR/managers** when negative emotions persist  
✅ Recommends personalized tasks aligned with the employee's mood  
✅ Tracks **historical emotional trends** to support mental health  
✅ Provides **team-wide mood analytics** to guide leadership strategies  
✅ Maintains **data privacy** by anonymizing and securely storing sensitive inputs

✨ **Why It Matters**:  
This system isn’t just about productivity—it’s about **people**. By proactively identifying emotional struggles and suggesting adaptive actions, Zidio creates a healthier, more empathetic workplace.

🔧 **Built With**:  
Python, Jupyter Notebook, Computer Vision, NLP, Speech Processing, Data Visualization, ML Models

👥 **Special thanks** to the guidance from mentors and peers during development.
